## What is 3ds Max Borderless Viewport?

**3ds Max Borderless Viewport** is an essential utility designed for 3D artists and designers who use Autodesk 3ds Max. It transforms the standard application window into a **borderless, seamless workspace**, eliminating the visual barrier of the window frame. This creates an immersive, distraction-free environment for modeling, texturing, and animating. Unlike the default windowed mode, which can minimize or cause focus issues, this borderless mode ensures the viewport remains stable and responsive, even when switching to reference images, material editors, or other critical applications.

This tool is invaluable for professionals seeking a fluid workflow, allowing for seamless alt-tab usage and efficient multitasking across multiple monitors without any performance degradation. By integrating the 3ds Max viewport seamlessly into your desktop, it enhances focus and productivity, making it a must-have for any serious 3D pipeline.
